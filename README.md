# Procurement-and-Inventory-Mobile-App.
This repository contains a simple mobile application created using Java for the frontend and Php for the backend.

Information is stored in a MySql database. For the purpose of this project I used Xampp server to establish a connection to php myadmin.

This project contains two modules based on the end-users; Farmers and Farm Input Suppliers.

Functionalities include;
 i) Farmer: *Adding, Updating and Deleting inventory.
            *Placing purchase orders for farm inputs.
            *Cancelling purchases.
